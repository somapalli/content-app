# 🧭 Architecture Document Generation Prompt for Copilot

You are an enterprise architecture assistant.  
Create a professionally written architecture document based on the details provided.  
Follow the required structure strictly and do not add fictitious content.  
If any detail is missing, state assumptions clearly.

---

## 📌 Context
We are designing a **Unified Merchant Data Model** for the Merchant Solutions Platform.  
The model integrates these conceptual entities:

- **U = Users** (internal/external)  
- **M = Merchants**  
- **E = Entitlements / Permissions**  
- **T = Transactions / Terminals**

Key use cases include:

1. Enforcing permissions for merchant access.  
2. Consolidated merchant profile with search.  
3. Managing merchant configuration and features.  
4. Viewing merchant channel enablement and system configuration.  
5. Controlling transaction access based on entitlements.

## 📌 Task
Create a complete architecture document using the exact sections listed below.  
Each section must be written clearly, professionally, and suitable for leadership or architecture review boards.

## 📌 Required Output Structure

### **1. Title**
Provide a precise, descriptive title for the architecture document.

### **2. Context / Background**
Explain why this architecture is needed, challenges with the current state, and business/technical motivations.

### **3. Problem Statement / Objective**
Describe the business and technical problem being solved and articulate the objectives of the unified data model.

### **4. Proposed Solution / High-Level Design**
Explain the proposed architecture, including conceptual entities (U, M, E, T) and their interactions.  
Summarize capabilities enabled by the solution.

### **5. Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs**
List 3–5 critical design decisions with rationale, pros/cons, and trade-offs.

### **6. Assumptions & Constraints**
Document assumptions, dependencies, compliance needs, performance expectations, or any constraints.

## 📌 Formatting Requirements
- Use **Markdown headings**, sub-headings, and bullets.  
- Write in a **professional architecture-document tone**.  
- Keep explanations crisp but meaningful.  
- Do **not fabricate** technical systems or details not provided.  
- If a detail is missing, add an **Assumption** subsection.

---

## 📌 Final Instruction
Provide the complete architecture document in one output.
