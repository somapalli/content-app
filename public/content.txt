Epic Description
Enable limited online access for clients even after their merchant account is closed due to chargebacks or regulatory reporting requirements (e.g., 1099K). Upon closure of a merchant account, the account status will be updated to "Pending Closure" in MDM for 13 additional months, during which clients will retain read-only access to historical data. No transactional or administrative actions will be allowed during this period. After the 13-month window, the account will be marked as fully closed and access will be revoked.

Benefit Hypothesis
By providing post-closure read-only access, we ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., access to 1099K reports) and enhance client satisfaction by offering a transparent and seamless experience. This approach reduces client support calls and operational overhead related to ad-hoc data requests while maintaining secure and controlled access.

Acceptance Criteria
Merchant Status Handling

Merchant accounts closed due to chargebacks or regulatory needs must be updated to "Pending Closure" in MDM for 13 months.

After 13 months, the account status must change to "Closed" and access is revoked.

Access Management

Clients with "Pending Closure" status must have read-only access via the merchant gateway.

All transactional features (e.g., refunds, chargebacks, configuration changes) are disabled during this period.

Reporting & Compliance

Clients must be able to download and view historical statements and regulatory documents (e.g., 1099K).

Access to the audit logs and historical data must remain secure and unchanged.

User Interface

A clear banner or message indicating limited access should be displayed to the user.

System should prompt users that no actions can be performed.

Security and Role Management

Only authorized users with valid credentials from the original account can log in during the pending closure phase.

Role-based access must ensure data integrity and prevent escalation or support ticket misuse.

Audit Logging

All read actions during the 13-month post-closure period must be logged for compliance purposes.
