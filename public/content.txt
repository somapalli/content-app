h3. Improved Process Workflow

|| Step || Process Description || Owner || Deliverable / Output ||
| *1. Vulnerability Notification* | Upon receiving a vulnerability alert, the team logs the issue in the tracking system and classifies it based on criticality and ownership (RTB or CTB). | Security / RTB | Logged vulnerability record |
| *2. RTB Assessment & Due Date Communication* | If categorized under RTB, the team assesses impact, sets the due date for remediation, and communicates it to all stakeholders. | RTB | Confirmed due date and communication record |
| *3. POAM Documentation* | RTB team collects confirmation and Change Request (CR) details and records them in the *Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM)* for audit and tracking. | RTB | Updated POAM entry with CR reference |
| *4. Patch & Remediation Completion* | RTB completes patching or mitigation, validates the fix, and informs the CTB team once the issue is resolved. | RTB | Patch completion and validation report |
| *5. Validation & Closure* | CTB team verifies the remediation, updates closure details, and marks the vulnerability as closed in the tracking system. | CTB | Closed vulnerability record and validation note |
