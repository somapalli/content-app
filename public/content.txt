Proposed Flow (Current State)
Gateway publishes settlement events to Kafka (settlement.raw).

Consumer A consumes settlement.raw, persists data to a temporary table, and emits settlement.raw.processed.

Consumer B consumes settlement.raw.processed and persists the data into the transaction table.

This follows a classic event-driven choreography pattern, where each consumer independently reacts to an event and publishes the next event in the chain.

Design Consideration (Future State)
As we plan the solution, we intend to continue with the event-based choreography model. At the same time, we want to design the components and contracts in a way that allows a smooth transition to an OpenCoreOS Fabric–based workflow in the future. The goal is to enable migration to a managed orchestration model with minimal refactoring, avoiding rework by keeping clear event boundaries, well-defined step responsibilities, and decoupled persistence and processing logic.
