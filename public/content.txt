## OpenCoreOS Fabric – Workflow & Integration Capabilities

### 1. Workflow Lifecycle

* **Start Workflow**
  Initiate a workflow instance based on a defined trigger.
* **Schedule**
  Execute workflows using time-based schedules (cron or interval).
* **Event Trigger**
  Start workflows in response to internal or external events.
* **Webhook Trigger**
  Invoke workflows through inbound HTTP webhooks.

---

### 2. Control Flow & Orchestration

* **Step-Based Orchestration**

  * Workflows are composed of discrete steps
  * Each step can access outputs from any previously executed step

* **Condition (Branching)**

  * Route execution paths based on evaluated expressions or business rules

* **Wait**

  * Pause workflow execution for a defined duration or until a condition is met

* **Loop & Iteration Patterns**

  * **Sequential** – Execute iterations one at a time in deterministic order
  * **Parallel** – Execute iterations concurrently to improve throughput
  * **Batch** – Execute iterations in configurable batches to balance performance and resource utilization

---

### 3. Data Parsing & Transformation

* **Extract**

  * Parse structured input formats such as CSV or JSON
* **Transform**

  * Reshape, map, and normalize data fields to target schemas

---

### 4. External Integrations

* **API Integration & Security**

  * Supports **Basic Authentication**
  * Supports **Bearer Token Authentication**
  * Supports **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials**
  * Credentials are securely managed by the platform
  * No support for JavaScript or Python to minimize security risk and enforce governance

* **HTTP**

  * Invoke external REST APIs (synchronous or asynchronous)

* **SFTP**

  * Secure file transfers using SFTP for batch-based integrations

---

### 5. OpenCoreOS Platform Services

* **Native Platform Integration**

  * Supports built-in OpenCoreOS services
  * Enables direct invocation of platform capabilities such as:

    * Create and update ledgers
    * Create, update, and manage accounts

---

### 6. Developer Experience & Debugging

* **Interactive Execution Interface**

  * Postman-like interface to execute, test, and debug workflows
  * Inspect request and response payloads at each step

* **Execution Visibility**

  * View step-level inputs, outputs, execution status, and errors

---

### 7. Workflow Lifecycle Management

* **Versioning**

  * Built-in workflow version management
  * Supports controlled evolution and backward compatibility

* **Environment Promotion**

  * Publish workflows across environments (Dev → QA → Prod)
  * Ensures consistency and governance during deployments

---

### 8. Execution Engine & Architecture

* **Temporal-Based Orchestration**

  * Fabric workflows are executed on top of Temporal
  * Custom DSL definitions are compiled into Temporal workflows internally
  * Inherits Temporal guarantees for durability, resilience, and fault tolerance
