Resolve the HttpClient library issue on the portal side and proceed with the QA4 deployment.
Schedule a meeting with the development teams — Mobile, API, and Portal — to review all expected outputs, including negative scenarios returned from DAL/Portal, and ensure the mobile application can properly handle each scenario.
Review any findings to determine whether updates are required on the mobile side.
Continue QA testing once the changes are deployed to QA4.
Conduct a final round of testing with full data setup, with all teams monitoring logs and dashboards to confirm everything is functioning as expected.
