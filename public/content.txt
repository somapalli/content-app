h3. Message Aggregation & Consolidation
The notification capability must support combining multiple related messages into a single consolidated notification.

Use Cases:

Multiple events generated within a short time window for the same merchant

Multiple reminders or alerts related to the same case or workflow

Batched notifications for internal operational teams

Business Requirements:

Ability to aggregate one or more messages into a single notification

Configurable aggregation window (e.g., X minutes, hourly, daily)

Grouping based on:
** Merchant or account
** Case, workflow, or transaction ID
** Notification type or category

Support summary-style messaging (e.g., “You have 3 pending chargebacks”)

Preserve individual event references within the aggregated message

Maintain auditability for each underlying event
