Over the past year, you made strong contributions across delivery, architecture, and operational readiness. The successful delivery of Version 1 was a significant milestone, enabling macro customers to accept card payments and onboarding existing customers onto the new platform. This was a critical business achievement and demonstrated your ability to deliver complex, high-impact initiatives.

You showed strong technical leadership by implementing an active/active architecture for the ACB application, leveraging a service mesh–enabled blue-green deployment strategy to support controlled traffic routing, resilience, and zero downtime during releases. This approach significantly improved deployment safety and production stability. The integration of Split.io for feature flagging, along with the development of reusable logging components, further strengthened release validation, observability, and operational confidence.

In addition to core platform work, you actively supported AI adoption across the team, exploring how AI-assisted tools could improve engineering efficiency, design reviews, documentation quality, and overall delivery speed. You encouraged teams to experiment with AI responsibly, positioning it as an enabler for productivity and consistency rather than a replacement for sound engineering judgment. This focus aligns well with broader organizational goals to leverage AI to enhance delivery outcomes and operational effectiveness.

You also played a key leadership role by leading the Architecture Review Board, driving architectural consistency across crews, and guiding teams through key design decisions. Your support during PI planning—particularly in defining technical objectives aligned with business priorities—helped improve alignment and execution across the program.

Throughout the year, you demonstrated a strong customer focus. Changes were validated promptly, and issues were reviewed quickly with business stakeholders to minimize impact. Your efforts to improve observability through dashboards and logs, along with strengthening knowledge transfer to the RTB team, have meaningfully improved operational readiness and support effectiveness.

Strengths

Strong technical delivery and architectural leadership

Effective use of service mesh patterns to enable resilience and zero-downtime deployments

Thoughtful advocacy for AI adoption to improve team efficiency and delivery quality

Consistent focus on customer experience, observability, and operational excellence

Clear ownership, accountability, and leadership presence

Focus area for next year

Continue strengthening collaboration between onsite and offshore leads to improve alignment and communication across development communities

Further improve delivery predictability by driving more consistent execution and planning discipline across crews

Engage earlier with business and partner teams to ensure requirements are fully reviewed and aligned before development begins

Improve operational handover by completing RTB readiness earlier to reduce dependency on development teams during production support

AI Tool Adoption: Expand hands-on adoption of AI tools and drive consistent usage across the team by establishing practical guidance and repeatable ways of working (e.g., for design reviews, documentation, test creation, and operational troubleshooting) to improve efficiency and delivery outcomes

With strong Phase 1.2 delivery ahead—spanning onboarding, servicing, ledgering, and payout—continue to drive clarity on upcoming worksets and execution readiness to ensure the teams are positioned for successful delivery
