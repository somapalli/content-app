h1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
h2. Notification Capability – Merchant Solutions Platform

---

h2. 1. Background & Context

The Merchant Solutions platform supports the end-to-end merchant lifecycle, including *sales, onboarding, underwriting, provisioning, card authorization, clearing and settlement, chargebacks, and payouts*.

Across these domains, timely and reliable notifications are critical to:

* Inform merchants of status changes and required actions
* Alert internal teams to workflow milestones and exceptions
* Meet regulatory, SLA, and audit requirements
* Reduce manual follow-ups and operational overhead

A centralized and reusable notification capability is required to support high-volume, event-driven merchant operations.

---

h2. 2. Business Objective

The objective of this initiative is to implement a *generic notification capability* that:

* Supports event-driven, request-driven, and time-based notifications
* Delivers notifications to both *external merchants* and *internal teams*
* Ensures high reliability, auditability, and observability
* Enables business-configurable messaging with governance controls
* Scales across all Merchant Solutions domains without custom implementations

---

h2. 3. Scope

h3. In Scope

* Merchant-facing and internal notifications
* Email, SMS, push, in-app, and webhook channels
* Template-driven messaging with localization
* Delivery tracking, retries, and error handling
* Reporting and operational visibility

h3. Out of Scope (Phase 1 – if applicable)

* Marketing or promotional campaigns
* Two-way conversational messaging
* AI-generated notification content

---

h2. 4. Notification Use Cases (Illustrative)

h3. Merchant-Facing

* Application submitted / approved / declined
* Underwriting additional information required
* Authorization declined
* Funding initiated or completed
* Chargeback received
* Chargeback evidence due
* Payout completed
* Invite-to-pay pending action

h3. Internal-Facing

* Manual underwriting required
* SLA breach alerts
* Provisioning failures
* Chargeback escalation
* Settlement exceptions
* System or integration failures

---

h2. 5. Triggering Mechanisms

h3. 5.1 Unsolicited (Event-Driven)
Triggered automatically based on business or system events.

*Examples:*

* Application submitted
* Authorization declined
* Chargeback received
* Settlement failure

*Business Expectations:*

* Near real-time delivery
* No user action required to initiate

---

h3. 5.2 Solicited (Request-Driven)
Triggered by explicit user or system requests.

*Examples:*

* Merchant uploads chargeback documentation
* User requests a notification resend
* Internal team manually triggers a status update

*Business Expectations:*

* Immediate or synchronous acknowledgment
* Idempotent behavior to prevent duplicate notifications

---

h3. 5.3 Scheduled / Time-Based
Triggered based on time, deadlines, or inactivity.

*Examples:*

* Chargeback evidence due in X days
* Reminder when no response after X days
* Invite-to-pay expiration reminders
* Agreement or document expiration alerts

*Business Expectations:*

* Configurable schedules and timing
* Business-controlled reminder frequency

---

h2. 6. Recipients & Targeting

h3. 6.1 External Recipients (Merchants)

* One or more users within a merchant hierarchy:
  ** Merchant owner
  ** Store manager
  ** Authorized users
* Support for multi-recipient delivery per notification

h3. 6.2 Internal Recipients

* One or more internal users or roles:
  ** Operations
  ** Underwriting
  ** Risk
  ** Support

*Business Requirement:*
Recipients must be dynamically determined based on:

* Merchant hierarchy
* Role or responsibility
* Workflow stage
* Geography or region (if applicable)

---

h2. 7. Message Content & Template Management

h3. 7.1 Template Management

* Pre-approved templates per notification type
* Channel-specific templates (Email, SMS, Push, etc.)
* Support for dynamic placeholders (e.g., merchant name, case ID, due date)

h3. 7.2 Governance & Approval

* Workflow for legal and compliance approval
* Versioning and audit trail for template changes
* Ability to activate or deactivate templates without code changes

h3. 7.3 Localization

* Multi-language support
* Region-specific date, time, and currency formatting

---

h2. 8. Reliability & Delivery Guarantees

The notification platform must support:

* *At-least-once delivery* for critical notifications
* Automatic retry mechanisms on transient failures
* Fallback channels (e.g., SMS if push fails)
* Deduplication to avoid duplicate notifications
* Configurable retry limits and backoff strategies

---

h2. 9. Status Tracking & Auditability

h3. Notification Lifecycle Status

* Created
* Sent
* Delivered
* Failed
* Read / Acknowledged (where applicable)

h3. Audit Requirements

* Timestamped audit trail
* Correlation to:

  ** Case or workflow ID
* Visibility for business, operations, and compliance teams

---

h2. 10. Error Handling & Exception Management

* Manual re-send capability for authorized users
* Alerts to internal operations teams for systemic failures
* Dashboards showing error trends and SLA breaches

---

h2. 11. Non-Functional Requirements (Business View)
