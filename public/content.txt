h2. 🛠️ Vulnerability Management – Process Improvement

h3. Objective
Enhance visibility, accountability, and traceability in the vulnerability management lifecycle between RTB (Run-the-Bank) and CTB (Change-the-Bank) teams.

---

h1. Epic: Observability Readiness for Business Services  
*Goal:* Ensure every business service and API is production-ready with standardized SLA definition, monitoring, traceability, performance testing, and a formal Permit to Operate (PTO) process.

---

h2. Story 1: Define SLA for the Service  
*As a* Service Owner  
*I want* clearly defined SLAs and SLOs for key user journeys, APIs, or business processes  
*So that* service performance expectations are measurable and aligned with business and operational goals  

*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- *Given* the service’s primary user journeys are documented  
- *When* SLOs are defined for availability, latency (p95/p99), error rate, and throughput  
- *Then* corresponding SLA targets are established per environment (Prod, Non-Prod) using historical or load-test data  
- SLAs and rationale are documented in the service runbook or README  
- External SLAs (if any) are captured and mapped to internal SLOs  
- SLA breach notification and escalation paths are documented in monitoring playbooks  

---

h2. Story 2: Monitoring & Traceability  
*As a* Developer  
*I want* all API calls and dependent transactions to be visible and traceable through the observability platform (e.g., Dynatrace)  
*So that* we can validate performance, reliability, and dependency health in real time  

*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- *Given* the API or service is deployed in <env>  
- *When* any transaction or API call is triggered  
- *Then* it must appear in *Dynatrace* with full trace visibility (entry point → downstream → DB/external services)  
- Metrics must include latency (p95/p99), error rate, throughput, and dependency call duration  
- Trace IDs must be correlated across services using standard header propagation (e.g., W3C Trace Context)  
- Screenshot or trace ID evidence is attached to the story before closure  
- Missing spans or partial traces are logged as observability gaps and tracked for remediation  

---

h2. Story 3: Performance Testing & Validation  
*As a* QA or Performance Engineer  
*I want* performance testing conducted with defined thresholds for throughput, latency, and error rate  
*So that* the service meets SLA/SLO expectations before going live  

*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- *Given* the service endpoints and user journeys are defined  
- *When* performance tests are executed using load tools (e.g., JMeter, Gatling, Locust)  
- *Then* the following metrics must be recorded and compared against SLOs:  
  - Latency (p50/p95/p99)  
  - Throughput (TPS)  
  - Error rate (%)  
  - CPU/memory utilization and scaling behavior  
- Test results and baselines are stored in the runbook or Confluence performance dashboard  
- Any deviation greater than 5% from defined SLOs must have remediation actions logged before release  
- Performance testing evidence is attached prior to PTO approval  

---

h2. Story 4: Permit to Operate (PTO) Readiness  
*As a* Service Owner  
*I want* a formal Permit to Operate checklist validated before go-live  
*So that* the service meets all operational readiness, observability, and reliability standards  

*Acceptance Criteria:*  
- *Given* SLA, monitoring, traceability, and performance validation are complete  
- *When* the service is ready for release  
- *Then* a PTO review is conducted and approved by SRE/Ops  
- The following artifacts must be attached for PTO approval:  
  - SLA/SLO document and monitoring setup evidence  
  - Dynatrace visibility screenshots or trace links  
  - Performance testing report and metrics baseline  
  - Runbook (including escalation contacts, alerts, rollback plan, and dashboard links)  
- PTO approval is captured in Jira or Confluence before production deployment  
- Any post-deployment reliability issues trigger a PTO review update and RCA documentation  

---

h2. Supporting Artifacts and Templates  
| Artifact | Description | Owner |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Runbook / README | Contains service overview, contact info, alert policies, and escalation | Service Owner |
| SLA / SLO Documentation | Baseline targets, rationale, and measurement sources | Service Owner |
| Dynatrace Dashboard | Real-time service metrics and dependency traceability | Developer / SRE |
| Performance Test Summary | Results and comparison against SLO targets | QA / Performance Engineer |
| PTO Checklist | Final readiness approval record | SRE / Ops Lead |

---

h3. Outcome  
Each business service that passes these four stories achieves full observability readiness and is eligible for production deployment with a valid Permit to Operate (PTO).
