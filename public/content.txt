Role: Software Architect & Senior Java Developer  
Context:
We need to build a Spring Boot component that connects to a third-party service to pull paginated data attributes, transform them, and enqueue each record for processing.  
A consumer service should read from the queue and create Jira issues based on the issue type.  
The system must be maintainable, resilient, and scalable.

Instructions:
1. Generate a **detailed software design** including:
   - Architecture description (text)
   - Sequence diagram (Mermaid)
   - Class diagram (PlantUML)
   - Component diagram (PlantUML)
2. Use modern best practices:
   - Spring Boot 3 / Java 17
   - Layered architecture: client, service, domain, messaging, repo, config
   - WebClient (Reactive) for external calls
   - Kafka for message queue (or alternative messaging abstraction)
   - Resilience4j for retries and rate-limits
   - Scheduler for API pull
   - Configurable via `application.yml`
3. Show the **Java class structure** for:
   - `ThirdPartyClient`
   - `ItemPullService`
   - `MappingService`
   - `IssuePublisher` & `IssueConsumer`
   - `JiraClient`
   - `OffsetRepository`
4. Include **sequence flow**:
   - Scheduler triggers `ItemPullService.fetchAndEnqueue()`
   - Pulls pages from third-party API
   - Publishes each `CreateIssueCommand` to Kafka
   - Consumer reads and calls Jira API to create issues
   - Errors → retry → DLQ
5. Output format:
   - Section 1: Textual architecture summary
   - Section 2: Mermaid sequence diagram
   - Section 3: PlantUML class diagram
   - Section 4: PlantUML component diagram
   - Section 5: Explanation of scalability, resilience, and maintainability aspects

Goal:
Produce a fully detailed architectural prompt with all diagrams and design explanations so developers can copy into Confluence or documentation tools directly.
