Got it — here’s a **success-criteria–focused version**, still using the **Problem → Temporal Capability → Validation** structure, but phrased so it clearly answers **“how do we know the PoC is successful?”**

---

## Temporal PoC – Success Criteria

---

### 1. **Workflow Durability & Recovery**

**Success Criteria**
Workflows reliably persist state and resume execution from the last successful step after failures, restarts, or redeployments.

**Temporal Capability**
Durable workflow execution with automatic state persistence and replay.

**Validation Points**

* Restart workers or pods during active workflows
* Confirm workflows resume without manual recovery
* Validate no duplicate or skipped execution steps

---

### 2. **Built-In Resiliency & Simplified Error Handling**

**Success Criteria**
Retries, timeouts, and failure handling are managed declaratively, eliminating custom resiliency logic in application code.

**Temporal Capability**
Configuration-driven retries, timeouts, and error handling at the workflow and activity level.

**Validation Points**

* Configure retry and timeout policies via configuration
* Simulate transient downstream failures
* Verify retries and backoff follow configured policies without code changes

---

### 3. **Operational Visibility & Control**

**Success Criteria**
Workflow execution, state, retries, and failures are fully observable and manageable by operations teams without deep code knowledge.

**Temporal Capability**
Built-in workflow visibility through Temporal UI and APIs.

**Validation Points**

* Track workflow progress and execution history in Temporal UI
* Identify failure points and retry attempts
* Validate operational teams can diagnose issues independently

---

### One-line summary (slide-ready)

> The PoC is successful if Temporal demonstrates durable recovery, configuration-driven resiliency, and full operational visibility with reduced development complexity.

If you want this **shortened further to bullet-only success statements** or **mapped directly to your current custom workflow gaps**, I can refine it one more level.
