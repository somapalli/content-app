Onboarding Models – Complete Comparison with Delivery Risk & Example Scenarios
Aspect	Option 1: Acquire Bank Provisions All (Product, Gateway, Processor)	Option 2: Acquire Bank Onboards Merchant; Gateway Provisions Processor
Process Flow	1. Merchant submits application to Acquire Bank.
2. Acquire Bank provisions:
• Merchant Product Setup (pricing, packages)
• Gateway account provisioning
• Processor account provisioning
3. Gateway/processor is notified of merchant readiness.	1. Merchant submits application to Acquire Bank.
2. Acquire Bank provisions:
• Merchant Product Setup
• Gateway account provisioning
3. Gateway triggers provisioning at processor.
4. Processor account created downstream.
Acquire Bank Control	Full control — bank manages provisioning chain end-to-end.	Partial control — bank manages merchant + gateway setup; processor provisioning logic is delegated to gateway.
Canonical Data Model	Bank’s canonical data model includes merchant → product → gateway → processor mapping. Processor IDs created and synced back directly.	Bank’s canonical data model includes merchant → product → gateway mapping. Processor details (IDs, tokens) synced via gateway callback/API.
Pros	- Strong system of record control.
- Easier compliance/security enforcement.
- Clear audit trail for regulators.
- Bank owns full customer experience.
- Knowledge gained by working directly with processors helps design a generic, reusable integration model that accelerates onboarding of future processors.
- Easier to swap out processors or gateways since integrations are bank-owned.	- Faster onboarding for each new processor (gateway automates provisioning).
- Lower complexity for bank (no need to build processor-specific adapters).
- Reduces duplicate integration work.
- Leverages gateway vendor’s processor expertise to reduce upfront effort.
Cons	- Higher initial delivery effort (bank must integrate with each processor).
- Slower initial speed-to-market until generic model matures.
- Requires more engineering and operational investment from bank.
- Risk of rework if processor APIs change frequently.	- Bank loses direct visibility/control of processor provisioning.
- Processor-level data may be delayed/incomplete.
- Harder to standardize data since mapping is managed at gateway.
- Increased vendor dependency — bank flexibility reduced.
- Bank does not accumulate reusable processor knowledge; always dependent on gateway.
Operational Risk	Lower risk — bank provisions everything and can capture failures directly in abstraction logs.	Higher risk — provisioning failures may occur at processor level without direct bank visibility, unless gateway provides detailed telemetry.
Delivery Risk	Moderate — single network (bank ↔ processor) simplifies alignment, but higher delivery effort on bank side.
Coordination mostly internal, with direct vendor engagement for each processor.	High — involves coordination across different networks (bank ↔ gateway ↔ processor).
Greater alignment challenges due to separate teams, governance structures, and communication layers.
More prone to delays if one party deprioritizes fixes.
Strategic Flexibility	High — easier to swap or add processors/gateways since bank owns and understands integrations.	Lower — tighter dependency on gateway vendor; limited flexibility if vendor’s processor roadmap or SLAs change.
Long-Term Outlook	Short-term: slower and more resource intensive.
Long-term: scalable and flexible with faster processor onboarding once generic model is established.	Short-term: quick wins and reduced complexity.
Long-term: risk of vendor lock-in and limited knowledge within bank.
Example Scenario	Onboarding Processor A (new partner): Bank builds a direct integration, learning processor’s API and mapping rules. While this takes longer initially, the knowledge is reusable for future Processor B, Processor C, etc. Integration patterns become standardized.	Onboarding Processor A (new partner): Gateway already has adapter or builds one quickly. Merchant is onboarded faster, but bank remains unaware of Processor A’s API details. If Processor B is added later, bank again relies entirely on gateway to deliver.
