Statement of Work (SOW): PING to Transmit Security Migration
Context

The current enterprise authentication solution relies on PING Identity to provide core authentication capabilities, including single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and API channel authentication. With the decision to migrate to Transmit Security, this SOW defines the scope, requirements, architecture approach, and deliverables to enable a successful transition.

Scope

Capture and document all existing authentication capabilities supported by PING (SSO, MFA, token issuance, client ID/secret provisioning, product subscription, two-legged and three-legged authentication flows).

Define user stories with acceptance criteria for equivalent and enhanced capabilities in Transmit Security.

Assess integration impact on dependent applications, APIs, and platforms (web, mobile, API channel).

Conduct architecture design for Transmit Security integration, including token services, federation, and identity proofing if required.

Identify Proof of Concept (POC) scenarios for high-risk or complex integrations (e.g., API token issuance, MFA orchestration).

Ensure compliance with enterprise security, risk, and regulatory standards.

Define migration and cutover strategy (parallel run, phased migration, rollback).

Deliverables

Requirements Stories & Acceptance Criteria

Documented backlog of user stories capturing current PING authentication capabilities and required Transmit Security equivalents.
