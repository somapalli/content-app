Absolutely — here’s a **clean, reusable Copilot prompt** you can drop straight into **GitHub Copilot / Copilot Chat / Copilot Studio**.
It’s designed to consistently generate a **formal, ARB-ready ADR** like the one we just built.

## 📌 Copilot Prompt: ODS Platform ADR (Oracle vs ClickHouse vs Elasticsearch)

### **System / Instruction Prompt (Recommended)**

> You are a **senior enterprise architect** writing an **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** for a large-scale financial services platform.
>
> Write in a **formal, neutral, architecture-review–board–ready tone**.
> Avoid marketing language.
> Focus on **workload characteristics, trade-offs, risk, scalability, cost, and operational impact**.
>
> The ADR must clearly justify decisions using **facts and system design principles**, not opinions.

---

### **User Prompt**

> Create a **formal Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** for selecting an **Operational Data Store (ODS)** platform to support **near–real-time merchant dashboards and internal operational views**.
>
> **Context**
>
> * Merchant platform requires dashboards for **planned funding visibility**
> * Drill-down required from **portfolio → merchant → date → transaction**
> * High-concurrency internal usage
> * Low-latency refresh (seconds to minutes)
> * Data volumes are high and growing
> * Financial correctness and auditability are mandatory
>
> **Current State**
>
> * All merchant and transaction data is stored in **Oracle**, which serves as the **system of record**
>
> **Alternatives to Evaluate**
>
> 1. Oracle-only ODS using columnar / in-memory features
> 2. Oracle + Elasticsearch
> 3. Oracle + ClickHouse
>
> **Decision Requirements**
>
> * Preserve Oracle as the system of record
> * Avoid OLTP performance impact
> * Support aggregation-heavy, read-intensive workloads
> * Scale predictably with volume and concurrency
> * Maintain cost efficiency
>
> **ADR Structure**
>
> * Title, Status, Date, Owners
> * Context
> * Decision
> * Detailed Rationale (include why Oracle columnar and Elasticsearch are less suitable)
> * Alternatives Considered (pros / cons)
> * Consequences (positive and trade-offs)
> * High-Level Architecture
> * Compliance and Risk Considerations
> * Next Steps
>
> **Key Points to Explicitly Address**
>
> * Why Oracle columnar features are insufficient for a high-concurrency ODS
> * Why Elasticsearch lags for financial aggregations and deep drill-downs
> * Why ClickHouse is better suited for numeric, columnar analytics
> * Importance of OLTP and analytics workload isolation
> * Cost and scalability implications
>
> **Outcome**
>
> * Select **Oracle as System of Record**
> * Select **ClickHouse as the Operational Data Store (ODS)**
> * Position Elasticsearch as optional for search/alerting only
>
> Write the ADR so it can be submitted directly to an **Architecture Review Board** without further editing.

## 🧠 Optional: Copilot Follow-Up Prompts

Use these after the ADR is generated:

### 🔹 Performance Sizing Add-On

> Add a performance sizing appendix assuming **2M+ transactions per day**, near–real-time ingestion, and dashboard concurrency. Include rationale for ClickHouse scaling.

### 🔹 Cost Comparison Add-On

> Add a cost comparison appendix contrasting **Oracle In-Memory ODS** vs **ClickHouse ODS** at scale.

### 🔹 Executive Summary

> Create a one-page executive summary of this ADR suitable for senior leadership.
