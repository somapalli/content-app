Got it — here’s a **clean, final ADR-ready version** with **only the two options you want**, clearly named and positioned, and with the key trade-offs called out 👌

---

## 🧾 **ADR: Merchant Pricing Calculation Strategy**

### **Context**

The platform must calculate **merchant pricing, fees, and adjustments** across authorization, clearing, and settlement for **all payment types**, supporting both **Blended** and **Cost-Plus** pricing models. The solution must reliably determine **gross and net amounts** while meeting **low-latency and high-availability** requirements for critical payment processing.

---

## **Option 1: In-House Pricing Calculation Engine with Cached Pricing from Zafin**

### **Description**

Build an internal pricing calculation engine that performs all fee, adjustment, and net/gross calculations in-house. **Zafin** acts as the **system of record** for contracts and pricing, with pricing data synchronized asynchronously and cached locally for runtime use.

### **Key Characteristics**

* Zafin stores contracts, pricing models, and fee configurations
* Pricing data is synchronized via scheduled or event-driven processes
* Local cache (e.g., in-memory / Redis) used for runtime pricing
* No real-time Zafin calls in the transaction processing path

### **Pros**

* ✅ No external dependency in the critical processing path
* ✅ Low latency and predictable performance
* ✅ High resiliency (pricing available even if Zafin is unavailable)
* ✅ Supports active/active and event-driven architectures
* ✅ Business-friendly pricing management via Zafin

### **Cons**

* ⚠️ Additional complexity to build and maintain sync, cache, and validation logic
* ⚠️ Requires governance for pricing versions and effective dates
* ⚠️ Eventual consistency between Zafin and cached pricing

---

## **Option 2: External Pricing via Zafin**

### **Description**

All pricing and fee calculations are performed by Zafin at runtime. The platform invokes Zafin services in real time during authorization and settlement to retrieve calculated pricing results.

### **Key Characteristics**

* Zafin is responsible for pricing logic and calculations
* Real-time service invocation for each pricing request
* Minimal internal pricing logic

### **Pros**

* ✅ Simplifies internal implementation
* ✅ Centralized pricing logic and governance
* ✅ Faster initial time to market
* ✅ Business users can manage pricing with minimal engineering involvement

### **Cons**

* ❌ Introduces external dependency in the critical transaction path
* ❌ Adds network latency to high-volume payment flows
* ❌ Availability and performance tied to Zafin SLAs
* ❌ Requires strong resiliency patterns (timeouts, retries, fallbacks)

## **Summary Comparison**

| Dimension             | Option 1: In-House + Cached Zafin | Option 2: External Zafin |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Runtime Dependency    | ✅ None                            | ❌ External               |
| Latency               | ✅ Lowest                          | ⚠️ Higher                |
| Resiliency            | ✅ High                            | ⚠️ Vendor-dependent      |
| Control & Flexibility | ✅ High                            | ⚠️ Limited               |
| Time to Market        | ⚠️ Medium                         | ✅ Faster                 |
| Operational Risk      | ✅ Lower                           | ⚠️ Higher                |

---

### **Key Consideration**

Option 1 prioritizes **performance, resiliency, and platform control**, while Option 2 prioritizes **simplicity and faster delivery** at the cost of **additional runtime dependency and latency**.
