# **README – Data Flattening Requirements for Merchant Solutions Platform**

## **1. Overview**

The Merchant Solutions platform contains distributed datasets across onboarding, underwriting, transaction processing, settlement, chargeback management, and merchant profile services. These datasets reside in operational schemas optimized for transaction processing, not analytics.

To support enterprise reporting, dashboarding, fraud analysis, and portfolio management, a **flattened analytical data model** is required.
This README summarizes the business requirements, personas, data domains, and technical expectations for building a unified flattened dataset.

---

## **2. Business Objectives**

* Provide consolidated analytics across onboarding, underwriting, merchant profile, transactions, and settlements.
* Enable business dashboards for sales, portfolio, risk, fraud, and operations teams.
* Support exportable reports (PDF, CSV) for compliance, business operations, and external stakeholders.
* Detect fraud anomalies and pipeline opportunities through unified data.
* Create a future-ready scalable data foundation for downstream integrations (BI tools, AI/ML models, risk engines).

---

## **3. Personas & Consumer Groups**

The flattened dataset must serve multiple user types:

| Persona                     | Needs                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Analysts**        | Trend reports, merchant performance, conversion funnel analysis |
| **Portfolio Managers**      | Portfolio profitability, merchant segmentation, fee summaries   |
| **Sales & Channel Teams**   | Onboarded merchant insights, industry performance               |
| **Fraud Analysts**          | Suspicious transaction identification, anomaly detection        |
| **Risk/Underwriting Teams** | Monitoring merchant health, chargebacks, settlement events      |
| **Segment Managers**        | Merchant grouping by segment, MCC, store hierarchy              |

---

## **4. Data Domains to be Flattened**

A complete analytics layer must unify the following source domains:

* Risk-based holds (automated/manual)
* Ability to analyze:

  * Reasons
  * Time to release
  * Impact analysis

---

## **6. Data Flattening Functional Requirements**

A flattened data layer must provide:

### **6.1 Unified Analytical Views**

* Create consolidated **merchant-centric** and **transaction-centric** tables.
* Merge onboarding, profile, underwriting, settlement, and transaction details.

### **6.2 Mandatory Field Coverage**

* All front-end UI fields used in reporting must be present.
* Include operational metadata:

  * Statuses, timestamps, event markers
  * Error codes, retry indicators
  * Risk flags

### **6.3 Drill-down Capability**

Support multi-level analytics:

```
Merchant
   └── Store
         └── MCC
               └── Transaction
```

### **6.4 Flexible Filtering**
