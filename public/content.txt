Data Ingestion & Modeling
Title: Ingest transaction and dispute data from Data Lake
User Story:
As a fraud system, I want to ingest transaction and dispute data from the Data Lake or event streams so that I can ensure all relevant activity is available for fraud analysis. This data should be stored in a structured format for downstream processing.

Title: Design fraud-ready data model
User Story:
As a data engineer, I want to design a data model that can store both card transactions and dispute records so that fraud rules can be efficiently applied on the structured data.

ðŸŸ¨ 2. Data Aggregation & Metrics
Title: Define aggregation metrics for fraud rules
User Story:
As a fraud analyst, I want to identify key aggregation metrics (e.g., transaction velocity, average amount) based on fraud rule requirements so that I can detect anomalies effectively.

Title: Aggregate transaction and dispute data
User Story:
As a system, I want to aggregate transaction and dispute data by card, merchant, and time window so that I can enable pattern-based fraud rule evaluation.

ðŸŸ¥ 3. Fraud Rule Management
Title: Define and configure fraud rules
User Story:
As a fraud team, I want to define applicable fraud rules for transactions and disputes so that exceptions can be detected in real-time based on thresholds and rule logic.

Title: Flag exceptions based on rule violations
User Story:
As a system, I want to evaluate rules on raw and aggregated data to flag suspicious transactions that may require holding settlement.

ðŸŸ¦ 4. Model Integration & Feedback Loop
Title: Send raw and flagged data to ML model
User Story:
As a system, I want to send both raw transaction data and exception flags to a fraud detection model so that the model can learn from patterns and improve accuracy.

Title: Capture model response and feedback loop
User Story:
As a system, I want to record the model's output and actions taken on flagged transactions so that we can enhance future rule accuracy and model learning.

ðŸŸª 5. Exception Review & Analyst Actions
Title: Display flagged exceptions to fraud analysts
User Story:
As a fraud analyst, I want to view flagged exception transactions in a dashboard so that I can investigate and take action before releasing them for settlement.

Title: Enable manual hold or release actions
User Story:
As a fraud analyst, I want to manually hold or release transactions based on my investigation so that I can prevent fraudulent activity while minimizing false positives.
